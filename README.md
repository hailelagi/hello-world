# hello-world
Just another repository
Hey nothing to look at over here just your average chemical engineering student trying
to learn code. I think I like python although at this point I'm pretty sure it hates me.
I'd really like to get into web development and design, so I guess Javascript and I have 
alot we'd like to know about ourselves stay tuned for more rubbish spagetti code that 
by some hopeful miracle will become descent enough to be improved on and maybe sorta
coulda :( become production quality? The utter blasphemy!
